#DEVELOPER TEST INSTRUCTIONS
Instructions
Create an application for review, which matches the requirements below.  There is no required time frame for this exercise.
Requirements
Create a console application, called Simple Calculator.
The core functions of the calculator:
•	When the application is run, it should prompt the user to input one number 
•	It should then prompt the user to enter another number
•	It should then prompt the user for an operator, either a “+” or a “-“
•	It should then output the results of applying the operator to the two numbers that were just entered.
For example:
> Enter a number: 5
> Enter another number: 3
> Enter an operator (+/-): -
> Result: 2

Extra functions the calculator should contain:
•	Numbers should be integers only
•	Validation of the user inputs
•	A logging implementation.  Note that logging doesn’t have to actually work – it is OK as long as a logging strategy is displayed
•	Simple Calculator needs to be easily extendable.  We may want to add other operators, or to work with decimals/binary/hex, add a GUI, etc.

#Extra Information
•	Please write the test solution in the same way you would write code to a “production level” standard
•	You may employ any coding techniques or libraries of your choice
Once you have completed the exercise, please submit all source code, including all solution, project, and source code files, for screening.  If you need more information, please contact the person who gave you this test.
